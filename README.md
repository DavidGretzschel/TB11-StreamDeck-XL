# TB11-StreamDeck-XL
all commands assinged to a hotkey, all hotkeys organized in folders on the StreamDeck XL


## version history

0.1
Still rough around the edges. Lots of unnecessary crap still left lying around.  
Some of the reference/natural shortcuts-stuff not completed.  
But good enough for now.  

## purpose
To provide a hotkey-profile with all the TB11-commands preset in a somewhat sensible order.  
To have those hotkeys easily accessible on the StreamDeck Xl, no mnemorization necessary.  
It's the first project I've been doing with the StreamDeck-meta-profile I created:  
https://github.com/DavidGretzschel/StreamDeckXL_Meta-Profile/blob/master/README.md


## to-do
Figure out which shortcuts belong to the mixed ctrl/ctrl+shift-category. Clean that up.  
Add used characters to all commands, so that people can passively mnemorize the hotkeys over time.  

## Installation
Download hotkeys.txt and import in TB11>preferences>keybindings>Import.  
Import StreamDeck-XL-profile.
