# TB11-StreamDeck-XL
all commands assinged to a hotkey, all hotkeys organized in folders on the StreamDeck XL


## version history

version to come:  
Each command having an identifying icon.  
Practical Keybindings-file for people without a StreamDeck (someaday) with a printout/learning guide.  
ctrl and alt-shortcuts for the most useful stuff.  
AHK-scripts to automate common TB11-function.  

0.4 [current]  
many, many changes. Loads more icons. One Folder is icon-complete (in content). All folders have one identifying icon.  
Freed control and alt completely for user shortcuts.  
Those are the most convenient modifiers for stuff you would probably want to do on the keyboard anyway.   
Deleted out some commands from the category, for later adding to ctrl and alt-groups.    
Unsure about how to exactly structure those "quick commands".  
  
0.3  
Moved Timeline>stuff away from shift-keybindings that are needed for starting a search in the Plex.  
Moved View>Timeline to the other Timeline-related commands.  
  
0.2  
Somehow the wrong hotkeys got uploaded the last time. Had to redo a lot of the work. Oh well...  
This is compliant with TB 11, version 33 now. So a lot of the Mac-exclusive shortcuts have been purged.  
I added some icons.  A galaxy to signify unused hotkeys. A comet to show that something is not quite right.  
Others to seperate categories visually from one another, should a folder have multiple.  
Finding free-to-use icons isn't as difficult as I thought, so I think, that I'll be slowly adding good icons for everything.  


0.1  
Still rough around the edges. Lots of unnecessary crap still left lying around.    
Some of the reference/natural shortcuts-stuff not completed.    
But good enough for now.    

## purpose
To provide a hotkey-profile with all the TB11-commands preset in a somewhat sensible order.  
To have those hotkeys easily accessible on the StreamDeck Xl, no mnemorization necessary.  
It's the first project I've been doing with the StreamDeck-meta-profile I created:

Specifically his aerospace pack.
More icons used, but those were purchased with a Premium membership, so I don't have to credit them right now.
Will figure out how to do that later, though.
